# misc-utils

A collection of small utilities I wrote to solve some problem I was having
at the time.

`fs_readonly_watchdog`: Reboot if filesystem is remounted read-only

`httpwatchdog.py`: Reboot kiosk if don't receive message over HTTP.

`wait-for-hr`: Like `sleep 3600` but always waits for the top of the hour.
